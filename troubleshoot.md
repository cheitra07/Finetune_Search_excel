You're getting the "Invalid Notebook – Not valid JSON" error because the `.ipynb` file might be corrupted or improperly saved during the export process. Here's how to **fix and successfully push your Colab notebook to GitHub**, even if "Save a copy in GitHub" fails.

### ✅ **Fix & Push Colab Notebook to GitHub Manually**

#### **Step 1: Download the notebook from Colab**

Go to:
**File > Download > Download .ipynb**

This gives you a clean local file.

---

#### **Step 2: Open the file in a text/code editor (optional)**

* Open with **VS Code**, **Jupyter Notebook**, or **Notepad++**
* Check if it starts with:

  ```json
  {
    "cells": [
  ```

  If not, the file is corrupted. Redownload or manually clean up.

---

#### **Step 3: Upload to GitHub manually**

* Go to your GitHub repository.
* Click **"Add file" > "Upload files"**
* Upload the `.ipynb` you downloaded.
* Commit the changes.

#### ✅ Alternative: Use Colab + Git commands (more reliable)

If you prefer command-line steps from Colab, follow this:

```python
# Set Git info
!git config --global user.email "you@example.com"
!git config --global user.name "Your Name"

# Clone your repo
!git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
%cd your-repo

# Copy notebook to repo
!cp /content/your_notebook.ipynb .

# Commit and push
!git add your_notebook.ipynb
!git commit -m "Add training notebook"
!git push https://your-username:your-token@github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```

Replace `your-token` with a GitHub [personal access token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens).
